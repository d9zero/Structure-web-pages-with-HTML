        <section> <p>A student made an appointment with me, as many do just before they graduate. They are nervous about the “real world” and want to come talk about what the future holds, knowing my history in the business might help shed some light on what they are about to face. When they enter my office other questions, which seemingly have very little to do with music, but in reality they have MUCH to do with being successful.
